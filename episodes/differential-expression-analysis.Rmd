# Differential Expression Analysis


**Load libraries**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("DESeq2"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("AnnotationDbi"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("org.Mm.eg.db"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("GO.db"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("EnhancedVolcano"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("tidyverse"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("clusterProfiler"))
```

**Reading Gene Expression Count matrix from Previous Lesson**

In this lesson, we will use the raw counts matrix and metadata
downloaded in the previous lesson and will perform differential
expression analysis.
```{r}
counts <- read.delim("../data/htseqcounts_5XFAD.txt", check.names = FALSE)
```

**Reading Sample Metadata from Previous Lesson**
```{r}
covars <- readRDS("../data/covars_5XFAD.rds")
```

Let’s explore the data:

Let’s look at the top of the metadata.
```{r}
head(covars)
```

identify distinct groups using sample metadata
```{r}
distinct(covars, sex, genotype, timepoint)
```

How many mice were used to produce this data?
```{r}
covars %>% group_by(sex,genotype,timepoint) %>% 
  dplyr::count()
```

How many rows and columns are there in counts?
```{r}
dim(counts)
```

In the counts matrix, genes are in rows and samples are in columns.
Let’s look at the first few rows.
```{r}
head(counts,n=5)
```

As you can see, the gene ids are ENSEMBL IDs. There is some risk that
these may not be unique. Let’s check whether any of the gene symbols are
duplicated. We will sum the number of duplicated gene symbols.
```{r}
sum(duplicated(rownames(counts)))
```

The sum equals zero, so there are no duplicated gene symbols, which is
good. Similarly, samples should be unique. Once again, let’s verify
this:
```{r}
sum(duplicated(colnames(counts)))
```

**Formatting the count matrix**

Now, as we see that gene_id is in first column of count matrix, but we
will need only count data in matrix, so we will change the gene_id
column to rownames. Converting the gene_id as rownames of count matrix
```{r}
counts <- counts %>% column_to_rownames(.,var="gene_id") %>% as.data.frame()
```

let’s confirm if change is done correctly
```{r}
head(counts,n=5)
```

As you can see from count table there are some genes that start with
“ENSG” and others start with “ENSMUSG”. “ENSG” referes to human gene
ENSEMBL id and “ENSMUSG” refer to mouse ENSEMBL id. Let’s check how many
gene_ids are NOT from the mouse genome by searching for the string “MUS”
(as in Mus musculus) in the rownames of count matrix
```{r}
counts[,1:6] %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(rownames(.), "MUS"))
```

Ok, so we see there are two human genes in out count matrix. Why? What
genes are they?

Briefly, 5xFAD mouse strain harbors two human transgenes APP
(“ENSG00000142192”) and PSEN1 (“ENSG00000080815”) and inserted into exon
2 of the mouse Thy1 gene. To validate 5XFAD strain and capture
expression of human transgene APP and PS1, a custom mouse genomic
sequence was created and we quantified expression of human as well as
mouse App (“ENSMUSG00000022892”) and Psen1 (“ENSMUSG00000019969”) genes
by our MODEL-AD RNA-Seq pipeline.

**Validation of 5xFAD mouse strain** 

First we convert the dataframe to
longer format and join our covariates by MouseID
```{r}
count_tpose <- counts  %>%
                rownames_to_column(.,var="gene_id") %>% 
                filter(gene_id %in% c("ENSG00000080815","ENSMUSG00000019969","ENSG00000142192","ENSMUSG00000022892")) %>% 
                pivot_longer(.,cols = -"gene_id",names_to = "specimenID",values_to="counts") %>% as.data.frame() %>%
                left_join(covars ,by="specimenID") %>% as.data.frame()
head(count_tpose) 
```
Rename the APP and PSEN1 genes to specify whether mouse or human
```{r}
#make the age column a factor and re-order the levels
count_tpose$timepoint <- factor(count_tpose$timepoint,levels=c("4 mo","6 mo","12 mo"))

# rename the gene id to gene symbol
count_tpose$gene_id[count_tpose$gene_id %in% "ENSG00000142192"] <- "Human APP"
count_tpose$gene_id[count_tpose$gene_id %in% "ENSG00000080815"] <- "Human PSEN1"
count_tpose$gene_id[count_tpose$gene_id %in% "ENSMUSG00000022892"] <- "Mouse App"
count_tpose$gene_id[count_tpose$gene_id %in% "ENSMUSG00000019969"] <- "Mouse Psen1"
```

Visualize orthologous genes
```{r}
#Create simple box plots showing normalized counts by genotype and time point, faceted by sex.
count_tpose %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=timepoint, y=counts, color=genotype)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge()) +
  facet_wrap(~sex+gene_id) +theme_bw()
```

You will notice expression of Human APP is higher in 5XFAD carriers but
lower in non-carriers. However mouse App expressed in both 5XFAD carrier
and non-carrier.

We are going to sum the counts from both ortholgous genes (human APP and
mouse App; human PSEN1 and mouse Psen1) and save summed expression as
expression of mouse genes, respectively to match with gene names in
control mice.
```{r}
#merge mouse and human APP gene raw count
counts[rownames(counts) %in% "ENSMUSG00000022892",] <- counts[rownames(counts) %in% "ENSMUSG00000022892",] + counts[rownames(counts) %in% "ENSG00000142192",]
counts <- counts[!rownames(counts) %in% c("ENSG00000142192"),]

#merge mouse and human PS1 gene raw count
counts[rownames(counts) %in% "ENSMUSG00000019969",] <- counts[rownames(counts) %in% "ENSMUSG00000019969",] + counts[rownames(counts) %in% "ENSG00000080815",]
counts <- counts[!rownames(counts) %in% c("ENSG00000080815"),]
```

Let’s verify if expression of both human genes have been merged or not:
```{r}
counts[,1:6] %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(rownames(.), "MUS"))

```

What proportion of genes have zero counts in all samples?
```{r}
gene_sums <- data.frame(gene_id = rownames(counts),
                        sums    = Matrix::rowSums(counts))
sum(gene_sums$sums == 0)
```

We can see that 9691 (17%) genes have no reads at all associated with
them. In the next lesson, we will remove genes that have no counts in
any samples.


## Differential Analysis using DESeq2 

Now, after exploring and formatting
the data, We will look for differential expression between the control
and 5xFAD mice at different ages for both sexes. The differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) can inform our understanding of how the 5XFAD
mutation affect the biological processes.

DESeq2 analysis consist of multiple steps. We are going to briefly
understand some of the important steps using subset of data and then we
will perform differential analysis on whole dataset. 

First, order the data (so counts and metadata specimenID orders match) and save as another
variable name
```{r}
rawdata <- counts[,sort(colnames(counts))]
metadata <- covars[sort(rownames(covars)),]

```

subset the counts matrix and sample metadata to include only 12 month
old male mice. You can amend the code to compare wild type and 5XFAD
mice from either sex, at any time point.
```{r}
meta.12M.Male <- metadata[(metadata$sex=="male" & metadata$timepoint=='12 mo'),]

meta.12M.Male
```

```{r}
dat <- as.matrix(rawdata[,colnames(rawdata) %in% rownames(meta.12M.Male)])
colnames(dat)
```

```{r}
rownames(meta.12M.Male)
```

```{r}
match(colnames(dat),rownames(meta.12M.Male))
```

Next, we build the DESeqDataSet using the following function:
```{r}
ddsHTSeq <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=dat, 
                                   colData=meta.12M.Male, 
                                   design = ~genotype)
```

```{r}
ddsHTSeq
```

**Pre-filtering** 

While it is not necessary to pre-filter low count genes
before running the DESeq2 functions, there are two reasons which make
pre-filtering useful: by removing rows in which there are very few
reads, we reduce the memory size of the dds data object, and we increase
the speed of the transformation and testing functions within DESeq2. It
can also improve visualizations, as features with no information for
differential expression are not plotted.

Here we perform a minimal pre-filtering to keep only rows that have at
least 10 reads total.
```{r}
ddsHTSeq <- ddsHTSeq[rowSums(counts(ddsHTSeq)) >= 10,]

ddsHTSeq
```

**Reference level** 

By default, R will choose a reference level for factors
based on alphabetical order. Then, if you never tell the DESeq2
functions which level you want to compare against (e.g. which level
represents the control group), the comparisons will be based on the
alphabetical order of the levels.

specifying the reference-level to 5XFAD_noncarrier:
```{r}
ddsHTSeq$genotype <- relevel(ddsHTSeq$genotype,ref="5XFAD_noncarrier")  
```

Run the standard differential expression analysis steps that is wrapped
into a single function, DESeq.
```{r}
dds <- DESeq(ddsHTSeq,parallel = TRUE)
```

Results tables are generated using the function results, which extracts
a results table with log2 fold changes, p values and adjusted p values.
By default the argument alpha is set to 0.1. If the adjusted p value
cutoff will be a value other than 0.1, alpha should be set to that
value:
```{r}
res <- results(dds,alpha=0.05)  # setting 0.05 as significant threshold
res
```

We can order our results table by the smallest p value:
```{r}
resOrdered <- res[order(res$pvalue),]

head(resOrdered,n=10)
```

we can summarize some basic tallies using the summary function.
```{r}
summary(res)
```

How many adjusted p-values were less than 0.05?
```{r}
sum(res$padj < 0.05, na.rm=TRUE)
```

How many adjusted p-values were less than 0.1?
```{r}
sum(res$padj < 0.1, na.rm=TRUE)
```

**Function to convert ensembleIDs to common gene names** 

We’ll use a package
to translate mouse ENSEMBL IDS to gene names. Run this function and they
will be called up when assembling results from the differential
expression analysis
```{r}
map_function.df <- function(x, inputtype, outputtype) {
  mapIds(
    org.Mm.eg.db,
    keys = row.names(x),
    column = outputtype,
    keytype = inputtype,
    multiVals = "first"
  )
}
```

**Generating Results table**

Here we will call the function to get the 'symbol' names of the genes incorporated into the results table, along with the columns we are most interested in
```{r}
All_res <- as.data.frame(res) %>% 
  mutate(symbol = map_function.df(res,"ENSEMBL","SYMBOL")) %>%    ##run map_function to add symbol of gene corresponding to ENSEBL ID
  mutate(EntrezGene = map_function.df(res,"ENSEMBL","ENTREZID")) %>%  ##run map_function to add Entrez ID of gene corresponding to ENSEBL ID
  dplyr::select("symbol", "EntrezGene","baseMean", "log2FoldChange", "lfcSE", "stat", "pvalue", "padj")

head(All_res)
```

**Extracting genes that are significantly expressed**

Let's subset all the genes with a pvalue < 0.05
```{r}
dseq_res <- subset(All_res[order(All_res$padj), ], padj < 0.05)
```

Wow! We have a lot of genes with apparently very strong statistically
significant differences between the control and 5xFAD carrier.
```{r}
dim(dseq_res)
```

```{r}
head(dseq_res)
```

## Exploring and exporting results 

**Exporting results to CSV files** 

we can save results file into a csv file like this:
```{r}
write.csv(All_res,file="../results/All_5xFAD_12months_male.csv")
write.csv(dseq_res,file="../results/DEG_5xFAD_12months_male.csv")
```

**Volcano plot** 

We can visualize the differential expression results using
Volcano plot function from EnhancedVolcano package. For the most basic
volcano plot, only a single data-frame, data-matrix, or tibble of test
results is required, containing point labels, log2FC, and adjusted or
unadjusted P values. The default cut-off for log2FC is \>\|2\|; the
default cut-off for P value is 10e-6.
```{r}
EnhancedVolcano(All_res,
                                   lab = (All_res$symbol),
                                   x = 'log2FoldChange',
                                   y = 'padj',legendPosition = 'none',
                                   title = 'Volcano plot:Differential Expression Results',
                                   subtitle = '',
                                   FCcutoff = 0.1,
                                   pCutoff = 0.05,
                                   xlim = c(-3, 6))
```

You can see that some top significantly expressed are
immune/inflammation-related genes such as Ctsd, C4b, Csf1 etc. These
genes are upregulated in the 5XFAD strain.


**Principal component plot of the samples**

Principal component analysis is a dimension reduction technique that reduces the dimensionality of these large matrixes into a linear coordinate system, so that we can more easily visualize what factors are contributing the most to variation in the dataset by graphing the principal components. 
```{r}
ddsHTSeq <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=as.matrix(rawdata), colData=metadata, design= ~ genotype)
```

```{r}
ddsHTSeq <- ddsHTSeq[rowSums(counts(ddsHTSeq)>1) >= 10, ]
dds <- DESeq(ddsHTSeq,parallel = TRUE)
```

```{r}
vsd <- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds, blind=FALSE)

plotPCA(vsd, intgroup=c("genotype", "sex","timepoint"))
```
We can see that clustering is occurring, though it's kind of hard to see exactly how they are clustering in this visualization.

It is also possible to customize the PCA plot using the ggplot function.
```{r}
pcaData <- plotPCA(vsd, intgroup=c("genotype", "sex","timepoint"), returnData=TRUE)
percentVar <- round(100 * attr(pcaData, "percentVar"))
ggplot(pcaData, aes(PC1, PC2,color=genotype, shape=sex)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) +
  geom_text(aes(label=timepoint),hjust=0.5, vjust=2,size =3.5) +
  labs(x= paste0("PC1: ",percentVar[1],"% variance"), y= paste0("PC2: ",percentVar[2],"% variance"))

```

PCA identified genotype and sex being a major source of variation in
between 5XFAD and WT mice. Female and male samples from the 5XFAD carriers 
clustered distinctly at all ages, suggesting the presence of sex-biased 
molecular changes in animals.


**Function for Differential analysis using DESeq2** 

Finally, we can build a function for differential analysis that consists of all 
above discussed steps. It will require to input sorted raw count matrix, sample 
metadata and define the reference group.
```{r}
DEG <- function(rawdata,meta,
                   include.batch = FALSE,
                   ref = ref) {
  dseq_res <- data.frame()
  All_res <- data.frame()
  
  if (include.batch) {
    cat("Including batch as covariate\n")
    design_formula <- ~ Batch + genotype
  }
  else{
    design_formula <- ~ genotype
  }
  
  dat2 <- as.matrix(rawdata[, colnames(rawdata) %in% rownames(meta)])
  ddsHTSeq <-
    DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = dat2,
                           colData = meta,
                           design = design_formula)
  ddsHTSeq <- ddsHTSeq[rowSums(counts(ddsHTSeq)) >= 10, ]
  ddsHTSeq$genotype <- relevel(ddsHTSeq$genotype, ref = ref)
  dds <- DESeq(ddsHTSeq, parallel = TRUE)
  
  res <- results(dds, alpha = 0.05)
  #summary(res)
  
  res$symbol <- map_function.df(res,"ENSEMBL","SYMBOL")
  
  res$EntrezGene <- map_function.df(res,"ENSEMBL","ENTREZID")
  
  All_res <<- as.data.frame(res[, c("symbol", "EntrezGene","baseMean", "log2FoldChange", "lfcSE", "stat", "pvalue", "padj")])

}
```

Let’s use this function to analyze all groups present in our data.

**Differential Analysis of all groups** 

First, we add a Group column to our metadata table that will combine all 
variables of interest (genotype, sex, and timepoint) for each sample.
```{r}
metadata$Group <- paste0(metadata$genotype,"-",metadata$sex,"-",metadata$timepoint)

unique(metadata$Group)
```

Next, we create a comparison table that has all cases and controls that
we would like to compare with each other. Here I have made comparison
groups for age and sex-matched 5xFAD carriers vs 5xFAD_noncarriers, with
carriers as the cases and noncarriers as the controls:
```{r}
comparisons <-  data.frame(control=c("5XFAD_noncarrier-male-4 mo", "5XFAD_noncarrier-female-4 mo", "5XFAD_noncarrier-male-6 mo", 
                                     "5XFAD_noncarrier-female-6 mo","5XFAD_noncarrier-male-12 mo", "5XFAD_noncarrier-female-12 mo"), 
                           case=c("5XFAD_carrier-male-4 mo", "5XFAD_carrier-female-4 mo", "5XFAD_carrier-male-6 mo", 
                                  "5XFAD_carrier-female-6 mo","5XFAD_carrier-male-12 mo", "5XFAD_carrier-female-12 mo")
                           )
```

```{r}
comparisons
```

Finally, we implement our DEG function on each case/control comparison of
interest and store the result table in a list and data frame:
```{r}
# initiate an empty list and data frame to save results
DE_5xFAD.list <- list()
DE_5xFAD.df <- data.frame()

for (i in 1:nrow(comparisons))
  {
    meta <- metadata[metadata$Group %in% comparisons[i,],]
    DEG(rawdata,meta,ref = "5XFAD_noncarrier")
    
    #append results in data frame
    DE_5xFAD.df <- rbind(DE_5xFAD.df,All_res %>% mutate(model="5xFAD",sex=unique(meta$sex),age=unique(meta$timepoint)))
    
    #append results in list
    DE_5xFAD.list[[i]] <- All_res
    names(DE_5xFAD.list)[i] <- paste0(comparisons[i,2])
}
```

Let’s explore the result stored in our list:
```{r}
names(DE_5xFAD.list)
```

We can easily extract the result table for any group of interest by using \$
and name of group. Let’s check top few rows from 5XFAD_carrier-male-4 mo
group:
```{r}
head(DE_5xFAD.list$`5XFAD_carrier-male-4 mo`)
```

Let’s check the result stored as dataframe:
```{r}
head(DE_5xFAD.df)
```

Check if result is present for all ages:
```{r}
unique((DE_5xFAD.df$age))
```

Check if result is present for both sexes:
```{r}
unique((DE_5xFAD.df$sex))
```

Check number of genes in each group:
```{r}
dplyr::count(DE_5xFAD.df,model,sex,age)
```

Check number of genes significantly differentially expressed in all
cases compared to age and sex-matched controls:
```{r}
degs.up <- map(DE_5xFAD.list, ~length(which(.x$padj<0.05 & .x$log2FoldChange>0)))
degs.down <- map(DE_5xFAD.list, ~length(which(.x$padj<0.05 & .x$log2FoldChange<0)))
deg <- data.frame(Cases=names(degs.up), Up_DEGs.pval.05=as.vector(unlist(degs.up)),Down_DEGs.pval.05=as.vector(unlist(degs.down)))
knitr::kable(deg)
```

Interestingly, in females more genes are differentially expressed at all age 
groups, and more genes are differentially expressed the older the mice get
in both sexes. 

## Pathway Enrichment 

We may wish to look for enrichment of biological
pathways in a list of differentially expressed genes. Here we will test
for enrichment of KEGG pathways using using enrichKEGG function in
clusterProfiler package.
```{r}
dat <- list(FAD_M_4=subset(DE_5xFAD.list$`5XFAD_carrier-male-4 mo`[order(DE_5xFAD.list$`5XFAD_carrier-male-4 mo`$padj), ], padj < 0.05) %>% pull(EntrezGene),
            FAD_F_4=subset(DE_5xFAD.list$`5XFAD_carrier-female-4 mo`[order(DE_5xFAD.list$`5XFAD_carrier-female-4 mo`$padj), ], padj < 0.05) %>% pull(EntrezGene))

## perform enrichment analysis
enrich_pathway <- compareCluster(dat,
                                 fun = "enrichKEGG",
                                  pvalueCutoff = 0.05,
                                  organism = "mmu"
                                 )

enrich_pathway@compareClusterResult$Description <- gsub(" - Mus musculus \\(house mouse)","",enrich_pathway@compareClusterResult$Description)
```

Let’s plot top enriched functions using dotplot function of
clusterProfiler package.
```{r}
clusterProfiler::dotplot(enrich_pathway,showCategory=10,font.size = 14,title="Enriched KEGG Pathways")
```

What does this plot infer?



## Save Data for Next Lesson

We will use the results data in the next
lesson. Save it now and we will load it at the beginning of the next
lesson. We will use R’s save command to save the objects in compressed,
binary format. The save command is useful when you want to save multiple
objects in one file.
```{r}
save(DE_5xFAD.df,DE_5xFAD.list,file="../results/DEAnalysis_5XFAD.Rdata")
```

## Session Info
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
