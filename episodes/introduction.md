## Introduction

This workshop will deliver hands-on training using the most recent computational techniques and omics data resources to improve awareness and utility of integrating multi-scale data from model systems and humans to uncover the mechanistic drivers of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). 

Despite considerable effort in drug development for AD, high rate of failure in clinical trials emphasize the need for more effective preclinical strategies, including targeted use of mouse models to study heterogenous disease phenotypes. In this era of omics-driven research, interspecies alignment of disease relevant molecular signatures relies heavily on bioinformatics tools and field-specific data infrastructures. 

The goal of this workshop is to accelerate translational research in AD by training interested scientists on how to develop robust computational workflows for both hypothesis-driven and data-driven research strategies. The AD-specific, bespoke lessons will use resources from the AD Knowledge Portal (https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org), a NIA designated FAIR data repository that shares data from human and non-human studies generated by multiple collaborative research programs focused on aging, dementia, and AD.
