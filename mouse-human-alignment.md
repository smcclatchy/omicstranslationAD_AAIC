## Aligning Human and Mouse Phenotype

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is complex, and we can not expect any animal model to 
fully recapitulate all aspects of late onset AD (LOAD) pathology. To study AD 
with animal models we must find dimensions through which we can align phenotypes 
between the models and human cohorts. In MODEL-AD we use the following data 
modalities to identify commonalities between mouse models and human cohorts:

1. Imaging (i.e. MRI and PET) to correspond with human imaging studies (e.g. 
[ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/))  
2. Neuropathological phenotypes   
3. *Lots* of 'omics --- genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics  

The 'omics comparisons allow for a much richer contrast, since a significant 
portion of genes are shared between these two species. Homology at the 
anatomical and neuropathological levels is less clear.

## Overview of Human cohort data

The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease Consortium [(AMP-AD)](https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Programs/DetailsPage?Program=AMP-AD) 
has generated extensive sets of 'omics data from a variety of human Alzheimer's 
disease cohorts. AMP-AD researchers are applying systems biology approaches 
toward the goal of elucidating AD mechanisms and highlighting potential 
therapeutic targets.

There are three large, independent human cohorts that are part of AMP-AD:

1. The Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project ([ROSMAP, syn3219045](https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Studies/DetailsPage/StudyDetails?Study=syn3219045)) 
2. Mount Sinai Brain Bank ([MSBB, syn3159438](https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Studies/DetailsPage/StudyDetails?Study=syn3159438))  
3. Mayo Clinic ([Mayo, syn5550404](https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Studies/DetailsPage/StudyDetails?Study=syn5550404)) 

These studies have collected postmortem RNA-seq profiles from over 1,200 
individuals spanning seven distinct brain regions: 
- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)   
- temporal cortex (TCX)  
- inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)  
- superior temporal gyrus (STG)  
- frontal pole (FP)  
- parahippocampal gyrus (PHG)  
- cerebellum (CBE)  

These samples are generally balanced for AD, MCI, and non-affected controls. The 
data provide a broad assessment on how AD affects multiple brain regions in 3 
different populations in the US.  

![Transcriptomic studies of Alzheimer's Disease](fig/rmd04-ampad_studies_regions.png)

Today we'll consider two different approaches to compare gene expression between 
human cohorts and model systems:

1. Correlation within co-expression module genes
  + correlations will be generally weak for all expression, but animal models may recapitulate specific aspects of the disease
  + we can use subsets of genes from co-expression modules, which represent genes expressed in similar patterns in AD, and look for correlations within these subsets
2. Correlation of functional enrichment results
  + another approach is to consider the functional annotation enriched among differentially expressed genes in human and mouse
  + we can similarly sub-divide these groups of co-functional genes into biological domains to aid our interpretation

## Overview of Human Consensus RNA-Seq Coexpression Modules

[Wan, et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107908) performed meta 
analysis including all available AMP-AD RNA-seq datasets and systematically 
defined correspondences between gene expression changes associated with AD in 
human brains. Briefly, the RNA-seq read libraries were normalized and covariates 
were adjusted for each human study separately before testing for differential 
expression using fixed/mixed effects modeling to account for batch effects. The 
expression data from each brain region was used to perform co-expression 
analysis using a variety of different algorithms, generating in total 2,978 
co-expression modules across all tissues. Of these, 660 modules showed 
enrichment for at least one AD-specific differentially expressed gene from the 
meta-analysis of all cases compared to controls.  

Wan *et al* clustered these modules together using network analyses and found 30 
co-expression modules related to LOAD pathology. Among the 30 aggregate 
co-expression modules, five consensus clusters were described that span brain 
region and study cohorts. These consensus clusters consist of subsets of modules 
which are associated with similar AD related changes across brain regions and 
cohorts. Wan *et al* looked for enrichment of cell -type signatures within the 
modules using expression-weighted cell type enrichment analysis 
([Skene and Grant, 2016](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00016)) and examined 
enrichment of functional annotations within the modules.

![AMP-AD GENE Modules](fig/rmd04-consensus_clusters.png)

This figure shows a matrix view of gene content overlap between the 30 
co-expression modules. You'll note a few strongly overlapping group of modules, 
implicating similar expression profiles in different studies and brain regions, 
which are the consensus clusters (A-E).

The first module block (consensus cluster A) is enriched for signatures of 
astrocytes, while the next block (consensus cluster B) is enriched for 
signatures of other cell types, including endothelial and microglial expressed 
genes, suggesting an inflammation component. The third module block (consensus 
cluster C) is strongly enriched for signatures of neuronal gene expression, 
linking the modules within this cluster to neurodegenerative processes. The 
fourth module block (consensus cluster D) is enriched for oligodendrocyte and 
other glial genes, indicating myelination and other neuronal support functions 
associated with these modules. Finally, consensus cluster E contains mixed 
modules that don't have clear cell type enrichments, but do have enrichments for 
processes involved in response to stress or unfolded proteins. Stress response 
is not cell specific, so the expression represented by these modules may be 
throughout many cells in the brain.


## Accessing AMP-AD module data

These AMP-AD co-expression modules are very useful for making comparisons 
between animal models and the human cohorts. In order to use these modules to 
make the comparisons, we'll need to download data pertaining to the 30 
co-expression modules. These data are available from the 
[Synapse data repository](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn11932957); 
let's download and take a closer look at the data. 


``` r
query <- synTableQuery("SELECT * FROM syn11932957")
module_table <- read.table(query$filepath, sep = ",",header = TRUE)
```

Let's look at module table

``` r
head(module_table)
```

Here you see 9 columns in this table. Columns we're interested in are:

- column 3: `GeneID` contains Ensembl gene IDs  
- column 4: `Module` is the module name in which gene is clustered  
- column 7: `brainRegion` is the tissue of the corresponding module  
- column 9: `external_gene_name` are gene symbols  

How many unique modules are in the table?

``` r
length(unique(module_table$Module))
```

What are the names of the modules?

``` r
unique(module_table$Module)
```

How many genes are in each module?

``` r
table(module_table$Module)
```

We can visualize this as bar plot using ggplot2 package. 

``` r
ggplot(module_table,aes(y=Module)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  theme_bw() 
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1

What are other ways to count genes in each module? 

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```r
dplyr::count(module_table, Module)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


We can also check the total number of unique genes in the table  

``` r
length(unique(module_table$GeneID))
```


#### Mouse orthologs of Human module genes  

In the module table we've downloaded we have human ENSEMBL ids and human gene 
symbols. In order to compare between human and mouse models, we will need to 
identify the corresponding mouse gene IDs. We are going to add the gene IDs of 
orthologous genes in mouse to the corresponding human genes in the module table. 

Orthology mapping can be tricky, but thankfully Wan *et al* have already 
identified mouse orthologs for each of the human genes using the HGNC Comparison 
of Orthology Predictions ([HCOP](https://www.genenames.org/tools/hcop/)) tool. 
While there are a variety of different ways to get data about gene orthology, 
for the sake of simplicity we are going to read that table from [Synapse](https://doi.org/10.7303/syn17010253.1).  


``` r
mouse.human.ortho <- fread(synapser::synGet("syn17010253")$path,check.names = F,header=T)
```

Let's take a look at the first few rows of this orthology table:  

``` r
head(mouse.human.ortho)
```

There are 15 columns with various gene identifiers for each species. We'll add 
mouse gene symbols from the ortholog table to the  module table by matching the 
human ENSEMBL IDs from both tables.  


``` r
module_table$Mouse_gene_name <-
  mouse.human.ortho$mouse_symbol[
    match(module_table$GeneID,mouse.human.ortho$human_ensembl_gene)
    ]
```

Taking a look at the module table, we can see the new column of mouse orthologs 
we just added.  


``` r
head(module_table)
```

Some genes don't have identified orthologs. Also there's some redundant 
information. Let's only keep the columns of interest and rows that contain a 
mouse ortholog mapping:  

``` r
ampad_modules <- module_table %>%
  distinct(tissue = brainRegion, module = Module, gene = GeneID, Mouse_gene_name) %>%
  filter(Mouse_gene_name != "")
```

Take a look at this new data table: 

``` r
head(ampad_modules)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 2

How many human genes are we removing that don't have identified orthologs? 

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```r
dplyr::filter(module_table, is.na(Mouse_gene_name)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(external_gene_name) %>% 
  dplyr::distinct() %>% 
  nrow()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Reading differential expression result of human data from meta-analysis

Now we know the genes that are in each AMP-AD co-expression cluster, along with 
the ID of the corresponding orthologous gene in mouse. We'll also need to know 
how these genes change expression in AD.

We'll download the results from differential expression meta-analysis of 
reprocessed AMP-AD RNA-seq data (all 7 brain regions). Log fold change values 
for human transcripts can be obtained from 
[Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn14237651).  


``` r
ampad_modules_raw <- fread(synapser::synGet("syn14237651")$path,check.names = F,header=T)
```

Let's take a look at these data  

``` r
head(ampad_modules_raw)
```

Data from which tissues are in this table?  

``` r
unique(ampad_modules_raw$Tissue)
```

All 7 brain regions are represented.

The AMP-AD data has been processed many ways and using different models and 
comparisons. Let's take a look at how many ways the data have been analyzed:  


``` r
ampad_modules_raw %>% select(Model, Comparison) %>% distinct()
```

For our analyses we'll use data from the "Diagnosis" model and comparisons 
between AD cases vs controls. We'll filter the table for these conditions and 
only keep the three columns we'll need: `Tissue`, `Gene` and `logFC`.  


``` r
ampad_fc <- ampad_modules_raw %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  filter(Model == "Diagnosis", Comparison == "AD-CONTROL") %>%
  dplyr::select(tissue = Tissue, gene = ensembl_gene_id, ampad_fc = logFC) %>% 
  distinct()
```


#### Combine with modules so correlation can be done per module

Next, we will combine the fold change table we just downloaded (`ampad_fc`) and 
module table from before (`ampad_modules`). First, let's look at both tables to 
check how can we merge them together?


``` r
head(ampad_fc)
head(ampad_modules)
```

The columns common to both tables are `gene` (the human Ensembl gene IDs) and 
`tissue` (the brain region corresponding to the module/measurement). So we will 
merge the data sets using these two columns. 

**Reminder**: Each gene can be present in multiple brain regions, but should 
only be in one module per brain region. Let's double check using the first gene 
in the table:


``` r
ampad_modules[ampad_modules$gene %in% "ENSG00000168439",]
```

This gene is present in six different co-expression modules all from different 
brain regions. You can do this for any other gene as well.

We'll merge the two tables using the `dplyr::inner_join` function:

``` r
ampad_modules_fc <- inner_join(ampad_modules, ampad_fc, by = c("gene", "tissue")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(symbol = Mouse_gene_name, module, ampad_fc) 
```

Take a look at the new table we just made:  

``` r
head(ampad_modules_fc)
```

We will use the data in `ampad_modules_fc` to compare with log fold change data 
measured in mouse models.

#### Preparing module information for correlation plots 
Let's package up these data and save this progress so far. This is some manual 
book-keeping to arrange the modules into consensus clusters for plotting later. 
You can just copy-paste this code into your `Rstudio` session.


``` r
cluster_a <- tibble(
  module = c("TCXblue", "PHGyellow", "IFGyellow"),
  cluster = "Consensus Cluster A (ECM organization)",
  cluster_label = "Consensus Cluster A\n(ECM organization)"
)

cluster_b <- tibble(
  module = c("DLPFCblue", "CBEturquoise", "STGblue", "PHGturquoise", "IFGturquoise", "TCXturquoise", "FPturquoise"),
  cluster = "Consensus Cluster B (Immune system)",
  cluster_label = "Consensus Cluster B\n(Immune system)"
)

cluster_c <- tibble(
  module = c("IFGbrown", "STGbrown", "DLPFCyellow", "TCXgreen", "FPyellow", "CBEyellow", "PHGbrown"),
  cluster = "Consensus Cluster C (Neuronal system)",
  cluster_label = "Consensus Cluster C\n(Neuronal system)"
)

cluster_d <- tibble(
  module = c("DLPFCbrown", "STGyellow", "PHGgreen", "CBEbrown", "TCXyellow", "IFGblue", "FPblue"),
  cluster = "Consensus Cluster D (Cell Cycle, NMD)",
  cluster_label = "Consensus Cluster D\n(Cell Cycle, NMD)"
)

cluster_e <- tibble(
  module = c("FPbrown", "CBEblue", "DLPFCturquoise", "TCXbrown", "STGturquoise", "PHGblue"),
  cluster = "Consensus Cluster E (Organelle Biogensis, Cellular stress response)",
  cluster_label = "Consensus Cluster E\n(Organelle Biogenesis,\nCellular stress response)"
)

module_clusters <- cluster_a %>%
  bind_rows(cluster_b) %>%
  bind_rows(cluster_c) %>%
  bind_rows(cluster_d) %>%
  bind_rows(cluster_e) %>%
  mutate(cluster_label = fct_inorder(cluster_label))

head(module_clusters)

mod <- module_clusters$module

save(ampad_modules_fc,module_clusters,mod,file="../data/AMPAD_Module_Data.RData")
```


## Correlation between mouse models and human AD modules

As demonstrated in the plots below, we'll aim to identify modules where the gene 
expression is correlated between human and mouse orthologs (left) as well as 
modules where there is no correlation (right). 

![Human-mouse logFCcorrelation](fig/rmd04-hs_mm_logfc_correlation.png)

There are two approaches that we commonly use to compute correlation between 
mouse data and human AD data:  

1. Compare change in expression in Human AD cases vs controls with change in expression in mouse models for each gene in a given module:  
  + LogFC(h) = log fold change in expression of human AD patients compared to control patients. 
  + LogFC(m) = log fold change in expression of mouse AD models compared to control mouse models.
    
  $$cor.test(LogFC(h), LogFC(m))$$
  
2. Compare Human AD expression changes to mouse genetic effects for each gene in a given module:  
  + h = human gene expression (Log2 RNA-seq Fold Change AD/control)
  + β = mouse gene expression effect from linear regression model (Log2 RNA-seq TPM)
    
  $$cor.test(LogFC(h), β)$$

Both approaches allow us to assess directional coherence between gene expression 
for genes in AMP-AD modules and the effects of genetic manipulations in mice. 
For this lesson we are going to use the first approach. 

#### Step 0: Reading Gene Expression Count matrix from Previous Lesson

We'll first read the result table saved after differential analysis in last [lesson](https://asliuyar.github.io/omicsTranslationAD/03-DESeq/index.html). 
We'll start with the data from the 5xFAD mouse model to understand the required 
steps to perform the correlation with human AD modules.


``` r
load("results/DEAnalysis_5XFAD.Rdata")
```

We can also load AMP-AD module data.

``` r
load("data/AMPAD_Module_Data.RData")
```


#### Step 1: Measure the correlation between mouse models for each sex at each age and AMP-AD modules using common genes from both datasets

We compute a Pearson correlation between changes in expression for each gene 
within a given module (log fold change for cases vs controls) with each mouse 
model (log fold change of the 5xFAD mice vs sex- and age-matched B6 mice). 

First, we'll combine both mouse `DE_5xFAD.df` and human `ampad_modules_fc` log 
fold change data sets for all genes.


``` r
model_vs_ampad <- inner_join(DE_5xFAD.df, ampad_modules_fc, by = c("symbol"), multiple = "all") 
```

**Note:** for this join we specify `multiple = "all"` so that the same gene can 
be matched across multiple human tissues.


``` r
head(model_vs_ampad)
```

Now we'll create a list column containing data frames using [tidyr::nest](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/nest.html) function. 
Nesting is implicitly a summarizing operation: you get one row for each group 
defined by the non-nested columns. 


``` r
df <- model_vs_ampad %>%
  dplyr::select(module, model, sex, age, symbol, log2FoldChange, ampad_fc) %>%
  group_by(module, model, sex, age) %>%
  nest(data = c(symbol, log2FoldChange, ampad_fc))
```

Let's take a look:  

``` r
head(df)
```

And we can also look at some of the nested data: 

``` r
head(df$data[[1]])
```

These are the mouse and human log fold-change values for all genes in the 
TCXblue module; the mouse data corresponds to 4 month old male 5xFAD mice.

The total number of groups in the data table:

``` r
dim(df)
```

Next, we'll compute correlation coefficients using the `cor.test` function:  

``` r
cor.df <- df  %>%
  mutate(
      cor_test = map(data, ~ cor.test(.x[["log2FoldChange"]], 
                                      .x[["ampad_fc"]], method = "pearson")),
      estimate = map_dbl(cor_test, "estimate"),
      p_value = map_dbl(cor_test, "p.value")
      ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(-cor_test)
```

Here we're using `purrr::map` based functions to apply the correlation test to 
every entry in the `data` column. We can pull out specific features from the 
`cor_test` list column, including the computed correlation coefficient 
(`estimate`) and the significance (`p.value`).

In the end we should have correlation coefficients and significance values for 
every comparison in our data table:


``` r
head(cor.df)
```

#### Step 2: Annotate correlation table to prepare for visualization

These steps will make it easier to make a nice looking plot during the next 
step. We'll add a column that flags whether the correlation is significant or 
not, and we'll add in the information about which consensus cluster each module 
belongs to:


``` r
model_module <- cor.df %>%
  mutate(significant = p_value < 0.05) %>%
  left_join(module_clusters, by = "module") %>%
  dplyr::select(cluster, cluster_label, module, model, sex, age,
                correlation = estimate, p_value, significant)
```


``` r
head(model_module)
```

#### Step 3: Create a dataframe to use as input for plotting the results
More preparations for plotting, here we'll get all of the values in the right 
order so that they are grouped together nicely on the plot.

``` r
order.model <- c("5xFAD (Male)", "5xFAD (Female)")

correlation_for_plot <- model_module %>%
    arrange(cluster) %>%
    mutate(
      module = factor(module,levels=mod),
      model_sex = glue::glue("{model} ({str_to_title(sex)})"),
    ) %>%
    arrange(model_sex) %>%
    mutate(
      age = factor(age, levels = c('4 mo','6 mo', '12 mo')),
      model_sex = factor(model_sex,levels=order.model),
      model_sex = fct_rev(model_sex),
    )

head(correlation_for_plot)
```

### Visualizing the Correlation plot
Now, we will use the above matrix and visualize the correlation results using 
`ggplot2` package functions.


``` r
data <- correlation_for_plot
range(correlation_for_plot$correlation)

ggplot2::ggplot() +
  
  # the AMP-AD modules will be along the x-axis, the mouse models will be along the y-axis
  ggplot2::geom_tile(data = data, ggplot2::aes(x = .data$module, y = .data$model_sex), colour = "black", fill = "white") +
  
  # each tile of the grid will be filled with a circle where the fill and size correspond to the correlation coefficient
  ggplot2::geom_point(data = dplyr::filter(data), ggplot2::aes(x = .data$module, y = .data$model_sex, colour = .data$correlation, size = abs(.data$correlation))) +
  
  # we'll draw a box arround significant correlations
  ggplot2::geom_point(data = dplyr::filter(data, .data$significant), ggplot2::aes(x = .data$module, y = .data$model_sex, colour = .data$correlation),color="black",shape=0,size=9) +
  
  # plot the x-axis on the top of the plot, set the parameters of the scales
  ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  ggplot2::scale_size(guide = "none", limits = c(0, 0.4)) +
  ggplot2::scale_color_gradient2(limits = c(-0.5, 0.5), low = "#85070C", high = "#164B6E", name = "Correlation", guide = ggplot2::guide_colorbar(ticks = FALSE)) +
  
  # remove axis labels
  ggplot2::labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  
  # facet the plot based on age range for the mice (rows) and consensus cluster (columns)
  ggplot2::facet_grid( rows = dplyr::vars(.data$age),cols = dplyr::vars(.data$cluster_label), scales = "free", space = "free",switch = 'y') +
  
  # specify how different aspects of the plot will look
  ggplot2::theme(
    strip.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(size = 10,colour = c("black")),
    strip.text.y.left = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 0,size = 12),
    axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0, size = 12),
    axis.text.y = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 0, size = 12),
    panel.background = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 0, vjust = -54, hjust = 0.03,size=12,face="bold"),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    panel.grid = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    legend.position = "right"
  )
```




![AMPAD - 5XFAD correlation plot](results/AMPAD1.png)

In the above plot, categories along the x-axis are the 30 AMP-AD co-expression 
modules grouped into 5 consensus clusters, while the categories along the y-axis 
show the different groupings of mouse models tested (split by age and sex). 
Positive correlations are shown in blue and negative correlations in red. Color 
intensity and size of the circles are proportional to the correlation 
coefficient.  Black squares around dots represent significant correlation at 
p-value=0.05 and non-significant correlations are left blank. 

Male and female 5xFAD mice display gene expression alterations across all five 
consensus clusters, with the strongest correlations observed among modules/genes 
in Consensus Cluster B, which generally consists of immune system pathways and 
functions. 

### Examining individual correlation results

Let's say we want to know more about a single comparison in the plot above and 
which genes are contributing to the correlation result. Maybe we're really 
interested in the correlations to the FPbrown module between female 5xFAD mice 
at 4 months and 6 months. We can plot the individual correlations for each 
comparison in the plot above with the data we have. We'll label genes with large 
fold change in the mouse using the `ggrepel::geom_label_repel` function. 


``` r
# specify which comparisons to consider
m <- 'FPbrown'
s <- 'female'
a <- c('4 mo','6 mo')

# filter the correlation data frame to these comparisons
indiv.corr <- cor.df %>% filter(module == m, sex == s, age %in% a) %>% unnest(data) %>% 
  mutate( facet = str_c(age, '\n', 'r = ',signif(estimate,3),' ; p = ',signif(p_value,3) ))

# plot
ggplot(indiv.corr, aes( log2FoldChange , ampad_fc ))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lwd = .1)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lwd = .1)+
  geom_point( size = .5, color = 'darkred')+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', lwd = .5)+
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel( data = arrange(indiv.corr, desc(abs(log2FoldChange))), 
                             aes(label = symbol), size = 2 ) +
  labs(x = '5xFAD logFC', y = 'AMP-AD logFC',
       title = unique(indiv.corr$module))+
  facet_wrap(~facet)+
  theme_bw()
```



![AMPAD - 5XFAD FPbrown correlation](../results/AMPAD_FPbrown.png)

Here we can see that the 5xFAD logFC are pretty small in general. The 
correlations are relatively weak and driven by individual genes that have 
relatively large changes (e.g. Heatr4, Nirp1a, Rpl39l). If we compare a 
different module, say STGblue, we can see a stronger relationship between the 
mouse and human expression.


``` r
m <- 'STGblue'
s <- 'female'
a <- c('4 mo','12 mo')

indiv.corr <- cor.df %>% filter(module == m, sex == s, age %in% a) %>% unnest(data) %>% 
  mutate( v = str_c(age, '\n', 'r = ',signif(estimate,3),' ; p = ',signif(p_value,3) ))

ggplot(indiv.corr, aes( log2FoldChange , ampad_fc ))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lwd = .1)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lwd = .1)+
  geom_point( size = .5, color = 'darkred')+

![AMPAD - 5XFAD STGblue correlation](../results/AMPAD_STGblue.png)

These correlations are much stronger (r ~ 0.3 vs 0.1 in the previous example), 
and there is a consistent pattern between young mice and old mice, with similar 
genes being expressed in similar ways (e.g. Itgax and Clec7a are up-regulated at 
both ages). We also saw in the Volcano plot that immune-related genes were 
significantly up-regulated in the 5xFAD model. These significant positive 
correlation suggests that the 5xFAD model captures inflammatory changes observed 
in human AD patients.

## Detecting functional coherence of gene sets from omics data

Most omics analyses produce data on many thousands of genomic features (i.e. 
transcripts, proteins, etc.) for each condition tested. Simply looking at these 
lists of genes and associated statistics can be daunting and uninformative. We 
need approaches to identify which biological functions are being impacted by a 
given experiment from these systems-level measurements.  

Gene functional enrichment analysis describes a variety of statistical methods 
that identify groups of genes that share a particular biological function or 
process and show differential association with experimental conditions. Most 
approaches compare some statistically valid set of differentially expressed 
features to sets of functional annotations for those features. There are many 
different functional annotation sets available, some of the more commonly used 
include:  

 * gene function resources, such as the [Gene Ontology](amigo.geneontology.org/amigo) (i.e. GO)    
 * pathway databases, such as [Reactome](reactome.org) or [KEGG](www.genome.jp/kegg/)   
 * disease and phenotype ontologies, such as the [Human Phenotype Ontology](hpo.jax.org/app), the [Mammalian Phenotype Ontology](www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/mp_ontology), and the [Disease Ontology](https://disease-ontology.org/)   

These are the resources that are the foundation for many genomics knowledge 
bases, such as [MGI](www.informatics.jax.org), 
[monarch initiative](monarchinitiative.org), and  the 
[Alliance of Genome Resources](alliancegenome.org). The precise nature of each 
of these resources varies, but the core information contained within each is the 
relationship of sets of genes to biologically meaningful annotations. These 
annotations are typically expertly curated from the published literature.

There are a variety of statistical approaches that can be employed to test for 
functional enrichment among genes identified from an omics dataset. Two of the 
most common broad classes of tests are *over-representation analysis (ORA)* and 
*gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)*. For example, consider the figure below 
from [Zhao & Rhee, Trends in Genetics (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2023.01.003). 
Let's consider each in a bit more detail.  

![Functional enrichment approaches](fig/rmd04-Zhao_Rhee_TrendsGenetics_pathway_enrichment.jpg)

### Over-representation analysis

`ORA` involves statistical tests of overlap between two lists of genes: one 
derived from the experiment and one from the functional annotations. For 
example, one might ask what is the overlap between the genes in an annotation 
class, such as "Lysosome", and the genes that are significantly up-regulated in 
a given experimental condition. These tests usually rely on some form of 
Fisher's exact test (e.g. `fisher.test()`) or hypergeometric test (e.g. 
`phyper()`). If the gene lists consist of a larger number of overlapping genes 
than would be expected at random - given the sample sizes involved - then there 
is said to be a statistical over-representation of the annotation class within 
the experimental condition.  

Of course, these overlap tests are generally considered for all annotation 
classes, which can number in the hundreds to thousands. Performing this many 
statistical tests ensures that many will be identified as significant by chance. 
Therefore, there is typically a requirement to correct for multiple testing 
errors (e.g. `p.adjust()`). 

There are many R packages available to handle the statistical tests and 
corrections involved in ORA. Today we'll use `clusterProfiler::enrichGO()`, 
which wraps statistical testing for overlap with GO terms and multiple test 
correction in one function. 

Let's start by considering the enrichments from the mouse data analyzed 
previously. 


``` r
theme_set(theme_bw())
load('results/DEAnalysis_5XFAD.RData')
```

We'll start by considering the genes that are significantly DE in 12 month old 
male animals

``` r
gene.list.up <- DE_5xFAD.df %>% 
  filter(sex == 'male', 
         age == '12 mo',
         padj <= 0.05, 
         log2FoldChange > 0) %>%
  arrange(desc(log2FoldChange)) %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(symbol), !is.na(symbol)) %>% 
  pull(symbol) %>% 
  unique()

gene.list.dn <- DE_5xFAD.df %>% 
  filter(sex == 'male', 
         age == '12 mo',
         padj <= 0.05, 
         log2FoldChange < 0) %>%
  arrange(desc(log2FoldChange)) %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(symbol), !is.na(symbol)) %>% 
  pull(symbol) %>% 
  unique()

length(gene.list.up)
length(gene.list.dn)
```

There are a total of  significantly up-regulated genes 
and  significantly down-regulated genes in this cohort. 
Now test for over representation of GO terms among the DEGs. First, we need to 
identify the universe of all possible genes which includes the genes that were 
both measured by the experiment and contained within the annotation set.


``` r
univ <- as.data.frame(org.Mm.egGO) %>% 
  pull(gene_id) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  bitr(., fromType = "ENTREZID", toType = 'SYMBOL', OrgDb = org.Mm.eg.db, drop = T) %>% 
  pull('SYMBOL') %>% 
  intersect(., DE_5xFAD.df$symbol)
```

Now let's test for enriched GO terms (this can take 3-4 minutes)


``` r
enr.up <- enrichGO(gene.list.up, 
                   ont = 'all', 
                   OrgDb = org.Mm.eg.db, 
                   keyType = 'SYMBOL',
                   universe = univ
                   )
enr.dn <- enrichGO(gene.list.dn, 
                   ont = 'all', 
                   OrgDb = org.Mm.eg.db, 
                   keyType = 'SYMBOL',
                   universe = univ
                   )
```

How many significant terms are identified:  

``` r
enr.up@result %>% filter(p.adjust <= 0.05) %>% pull(ID) %>% unique() %>% length()
enr.dn@result %>% filter(p.adjust <= 0.05) %>% pull(ID) %>% unique() %>% length()
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 4

How many significant terms are identified from the up-regulated gene list if you do not specify the "universe"?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```r
 enrichGO(gene.list.up, ont = 'all', OrgDb = org.Mm.eg.db, keyType = 'SYMBOL') %>% 
   .@result %>% filter(p.adjust <= 0.05) %>% pull(ID) %>% unique() %>% length()  
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Plot the top 10 significant terms:  

``` r
cowplot::plot_grid(
  dotplot(enr.dn, showCategory = 10) + ggtitle('down'),
  dotplot(enr.up, showCategory = 10) + ggtitle('up')
)
```



![significantTerms](../results/significantTerms.png) 

From this we can see that nervous system related terms (e.g. "learning or 
memory", "neurotransmitter transport") are down in 5xFAD males at 12 months, 
while immune functions (e.g. "cytokine-mediated signaling pathway" and 
"leukocyte mediated immunity") are up in 5xFAD males at 12 months.  

### Gene set enrichment analysis

`GSEA` is an alternative approach that uses a statistical measure from the omics 
data (e.g. the log fold change or significance) to rank the genes. An 
"enrichment score" is calculated for each annotation set based on where the 
genes annotated to the term sit in the overall distribution. 

Let's analyze those same data with the `clusterProfiler::gseGO()` function. 
First we'll specify the gene list and use the `log2FoldChange` value to rank the 
genes in the list.  


``` r
gene.list <- DE_5xFAD.df %>% 
  filter(sex == 'male', 
         age == '12 mo',
         padj <= 0.05
         ) %>%
  arrange(desc(log2FoldChange)) %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(symbol), !is.na(symbol)) %>% 
  pull(log2FoldChange, name = symbol)
```

Now we'll test for enrichment:  


``` r
enr <- gseGO(gene.list, ont = 'all', OrgDb = org.Mm.eg.db, keyType = 'SYMBOL')
```

How many significant terms are identified:  


``` r
enr@result %>% filter(p.adjust <= 0.05) %>% pull(ID) %>% unique() %>% length()
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 5

The tally above represents all genes, both up- and down-regulatd. To compare between GSEA and ORA, can you identify how many GSEA enriched terms are associated with up-regulated genes and how many are associated with down-regulated genes? (Hint: the `NES` value within the results relates to the directionality of enrichment). 

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```r
 enr@result %>% filter(p.adjust <= 0.05, NES < 0) %>% pull(ID) %>% unique() %>% length()  
 enr@result %>% filter(p.adjust <= 0.05, NES > 0) %>% pull(ID) %>% unique() %>% length()
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Plot the term enrichments


``` r
ridgeplot(enr, core_enrichment = T, showCategory = 15)
```



![ridgeplot](../results/ridgePlot.png)

This plot shows the top 15 GSEA enriched terms. The displayed terms are all from 
the up-regulated class (i.e. `NES > 0`), and consist of many immune-relevant 
terms (e.g. "immune response" and "cytokine production"). 

### Common pitfalls & best practices

These kinds of functional enrichment analyses are very common, but not all 
results reported are equal! A recent paper describes an 
["Urgent need for consistent standards in functional enrichment analysis"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009935). 
They examine how the results of functional enrichment analyses are reported in 
the literature, and identify several common shortcomings. Watch out for these 
common mistakes when performing and reporting your own analyses!

## Alzheimers's Disease Biological Domains

While these results are informative and help to provide essential biological 
context to the results of the omics experiment, it is difficult to understand 
all of the enriched terms and what that means for the biology of disease. It 
would be useful to group each of the enriched terms within broader areas of 
disease biology. There are several common molecular endophenotypes that are 
detected within human Alzheimer's cohorts across omics data types 
(transcriptomics, proteomics, and genetics). Several of these endophenotypic 
areas are shown in the figure below (source: Jesse Wiley).  

![Endophenotypes of AD](fig/rmd04-AD_endophenotypes.png)

These endophenotypes describe molecular processes that are dysregulated by or 
during the disease process. Very similar sets of endophenotypes have been 
cataloged among the targets of therapeutics in clinical trials for AD 
(see below, [Cummings et al, Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline: 2023, Alz Dem TRCI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10210334/).  

![Common AD Research Ontology](fig/rmd04-CADRO_2023.jpg)

![Drugs in Pipeline by CADRO](fig/rmd04-CADRO_2023_2.jpg)

In order to formalize and operationalize these endophenotypic areas, the 
[Emory-Sage-SGC center of the TREAT-AD consortium](treatad.org/emory-sage-sgc/) 
has developed the [Biological Domains of AD](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/trc2.12461). 
In the enumeration of these domains, several criteria were established; the 
biological domains defined should be:  

 * *objective:* leverage existing well-annotated resources  
 * *automatable:* in CADRO, therapeutics and targets are manually assigned  
 * *intelligible:* groupings should be easy to understand  
 * *modifiable:* definitions should be (and are!) continuously be updated. 

In all, 19 distinct biological domains (aka biodomains) have been identified. 
These biological domains are defined using sets of GO terms that align with the 
endophenotype. For example, terms like "cytokine receptor binding" and 
"leukocyte migration" are annotated to the `Immune Response` biodomain, while 
terms like "postsynaptic density" and "synaptic vesicle cycle" are annotated to 
the `Synapse` biodomain. Of all terms in the GO, 7,127 terms (16.4%) are 
annotated to one of the biological domains. Because the GO terms have genes 
annotated, genes can be associated with specific endophenotypes via the 
biological domain groupings of terms. In all, 18,289 genes are annotated to at 
least 1 biodomain term. While the biodomains exhibit very few overlapping GO 
terms (panel A), due to gene pleiotropy (etc) the number of overlapping genes 
between biological domains is quite a bit higher (panel B). The development of 
the biological domains is described in more detail in the published paper 
[Genetic and Multi-omic Risk Assessment of Alzheimer’s Disease Implicates Core Associated Biological Domains](doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12461). 

![AD Biodomain Demographics](fig/rmd04-score_domains_preprint_F1_cropped.jpeg)

### Download and explore the biological domain annotations

First let's download the biodomain definition file from synapse.  

``` r
#synLogin()

# biodomain definitions
biodom <- readRDS(synGet('syn25428992')$path)
dom.lab <- read_csv(synGet('syn26856828')$path)
```

What is in the file?

``` r
head(biodom)
```

You can see the file is a list of GO term accessions (`GO_ID`) and names 
(`GOterm_Name`) as well as the corresponding endophenotype (`Biodomain`) to 
which the term is annotated. There are also gene annotations for each term. 
These annotation sets come from two sources: (1) the `symbol` and `uniprot` 
annotations are drawn directly from the Gene Ontology via the provided API, (2) 
`ensembl_id`, `entrez_id`, and `hgnc_symbol` are from BioMart annotations 
(e.g. `biomaRt::getLDS()`).  

We can see how many GO terms are annotated to each biodomain: 


``` r
biodom %>% group_by(Biodomain) %>% summarise(n_term = length(unique(GO_ID))) %>% arrange(n_term) 
```

The biodomains range in size from `Tau Homeostasis` (10 terms) up to `Synapse` 
(1,379 terms).

We can also investigate the individual genes annotated to each biodomain GO 
term.


``` r
biodom %>% filter(GOterm_Name == 'amyloid-beta formation') %>% pull(symbol) %>% unlist()
```

So the genes associated with `amyloid-beta formation` within the 
`APP Metabolism` biodomain include PSEN1, PSEN2, BACE1, ABCA7, NCSTN, and 
others.  

### Annotate enriched terms with biological domain 

Let's re-characterize the 5xFAD functional enrichments we computed previously 
with the biological domain annotations and see if we can get more context about 
what is changing in that model. We'll focus on the GSEA results and start by 
annotating the results with biodomain groupings.  


``` r
enr.bd = enr@result %>% 
  left_join(., biodom %>% select(Biodomain, ID = GO_ID), by = 'ID') %>% 
  relocate(Biodomain)

head(enr.bd[,1:4])
```

Not all of the enriched terms are annotated to a biological domain. Some terms 
are too broad and not specific (e.g. 'defense response'), while others may not 
have been captured by a biological domain annotation yet (e.g. 'regulation of 
immune system process'). Remember that the conception of the biodomains involved 
a requirement that they be modifiable, and these terms may be added to the 
biodomain definintions in the future. Let's modify the `Biodomain` value for 
terms that aren't annotated to a domain to 'none'.  


``` r
enr.bd$Biodomain[is.na(enr.bd$Biodomain)] <- 'none'
head(enr.bd[,1:4])
```

How many terms are enriched from each domain?


``` r
bd.tally = tibble(domain = c(unique(biodom$Biodomain), 'none')) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    n_term = biodom$GO_ID[ biodom$Biodomain == domain ] %>% unique() %>% length(),
    n_sig_term = enr.bd$ID[ enr.bd$Biodomain == domain ] %>% unique() %>% length()
    )
arrange(bd.tally, desc(n_sig_term))
```

Many enriched terms don't map to a domain (), but most do (). Of those that do, the vast majority map into the `Immune Response` biodomain.  

We can plot the enrichment results, stratified by biodomain:  


``` r
enr.bd_plot <- full_join(enr.bd, dom.lab, by = c('Biodomain' = 'domain')) %>% 
  mutate(Biodomain = factor(Biodomain, levels = arrange(bd.tally, n_sig_term) %>% pull(domain))) %>% 
  arrange(Biodomain, p.adjust) 

ggplot(enr.bd_plot, aes(NES, Biodomain)) +
  geom_violin(data = subset(enr.bd_plot, NES > 0), 
              aes(color = color), scale = 'width')+
  geom_violin(data = subset(enr.bd_plot, NES < 0), 
              aes(color = color), scale = 'width')+
  geom_jitter(aes(size = -log10(p.adjust), fill = color), 
              color = 'grey20', shape = 21, alpha = .3)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lwd = .1)+
  scale_y_discrete(drop = F)+
  scale_fill_identity()+scale_color_identity()
```



![ridgeplot](../results/biodom_plot.png)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 6

How could you plot the results from the ORA to show biodomain enrichements?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```r
 enr.ora = bind_rows(
  enr.up@result %>% mutate(dir = 'up'),
  enr.dn@result %>% mutate(dir = 'dn')
  ) %>% 
  left_join(., biodom %>% select(Biodomain, ID = GO_ID), by = 'ID') %>% 
  relocate(Biodomain)

 enr.ora$Biodomain[is.na(enr.ora$Biodomain)] <- 'none'
 
 bd.tally = tibble(domain = c(unique(biodom$Biodomain), 'none')) %>% 
   rowwise() %>% 
   mutate(
     n_term = biodom$GO_ID[ biodom$Biodomain == domain ] %>% unique() %>% length(),
     n_sig_term = enr.ora$ID[ enr.ora$Biodomain == domain ] %>% unique() %>% length()
     )

 enr.ora <- full_join(enr.ora, dom.lab, by = c('Biodomain' = 'domain')) %>% 
   mutate(Biodomain = factor(Biodomain, levels = arrange(bd.tally, n_sig_term) %>% pull(domain))) %>% 
   arrange(Biodomain, p.adjust) %>% 
   mutate(signed_logP = -log10(p.adjust),
          signed_logP = if_else(dir == 'dn', -1*signed_logP, signed_logP))
   
 ggplot(enr.ora, aes(signed_logP, Biodomain)) +
   geom_violin(data = subset(enr.ora, dir == 'up'), aes(color = color), scale = 'width')+
   geom_violin(data = subset(enr.ora, dir == 'dn'), aes(color = color), scale = 'width')+
   geom_jitter(aes(size = Count, fill = color), color = 'grey20', shape = 21, alpha = .3)+
   geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lwd = .1)+
   scale_y_discrete(drop = F)+
   scale_fill_identity()+scale_color_identity()
```

Based on the gene list (up or down) we can add a sign to the significance. When we plot this we can see there are many more significantly enriched terms from the ORA. The dominant signal is still the up-regulation of terms from the `Immune Response` biodomain. There is also nearly exclusive up-regulation of terms from the `Autophagy`, `Metal Binding and Homeostasis`, `Oxidative Stress`, and `APP Metabolism` domains. The most down-regulated terms are from the `Synapse` biodomain.

### Comparing Human and Mouse functional enrichments

Finally let's consider how we can compare the functional enrichments in the 
mouse models with functional enrichments from the AMP-AD cohorts. We can first 
take a look at the functional enrichments from the different human cohorts. To 
save some time, let's load some pre-computed enrichment results for mouse & 
human data.  


``` r
mm.gsea <- bind_rows(
  read_tsv('data/5xFAD_gsea_results.tsv', col_types = cols()) %>%
    mutate(age = str_remove_all(age, ' mo') %>% as.double()),
  read_tsv('data/LOAD1_gsea_results.tsv', col_types = cols())
)

hs.gsea <- read_tsv('data/Hsap_gsea_results.tsv', col_types = cols())
```

The cohorts and tissues available are:

``` r
hs.gsea %>% select(Study, Tissue) %>% distinct()
```

``` output
# A tibble: 6 × 2
  Study  Tissue
  <chr>  <chr> 
1 MAYO   CBE   
2 MAYO   TCX   
3 MSSM   STG   
4 MSSM   PHG   
5 MSSM   IFG   
6 ROSMAP DLPFC 
```

We can focus on one tissue per cohort, let's look at TCX for Mayo, PHG for Mt 
Sinai, and DLPFC for ROSMAP. 


``` r
enr.bd = hs.gsea %>% 
  filter(Tissue %in% c('TCX','PHG','DLPFC')) %>%

Huh, the Mayo and MSSM look largely similar, but the ROSMAP DLPFC doesn't have 
very many enriched terms. Let's ignore the ROSMAP result for now and compare the 
terms enriched between Mayo TCX and the 5xFAD males. First we can join up the 
enriched terms between the sets into one data frame.


``` r
comb_5x = bind_rows(
  hs.gsea %>% 
    filter(Study == 'MAYO', Tissue == 'TCX') %>% 
    mutate(species = 'hs') %>% 
    select(ID, Description, species, NES, p.adjust),
  mm.gsea %>% 
    filter(model == '5xFAD', sex == 'male', age == 12) %>% 
    mutate(species = 'mm') %>% 
    select(ID, Description, species, NES, p.adjust)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(ID, Description), 
              names_from = species, 
              values_from = NES
  ) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(hs,mm)) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(hs,mm), ~ if_else(is.na(.x), 0, .x)))


head(comb_5x)
```

``` output
# A tibble: 6 × 4

Great! Now let's annotate the biodomains and plot it up:


``` r
enr.bd <- comb_5x %>% 
  left_join(., biodom %>% select(Biodomain, ID = GO_ID), by = 'ID') %>% 
  relocate(Biodomain) %>% 
  mutate(Biodomain = if_else( is.na(Biodomain), 'none', Biodomain))

bd.tally = tibble(domain = c(unique(biodom$Biodomain), 'none')) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    n_term = biodom$GO_ID[ biodom$Biodomain == domain ] %>% unique() %>% length(),
    n_sig_term = enr.bd$ID[ enr.bd$Biodomain == domain ] %>% unique() %>% length()
    )

enr.bd <- full_join(enr.bd, dom.lab, by = c('Biodomain' = 'domain')) %>% 
  mutate(Biodomain = factor(Biodomain, 
                            levels = arrange(bd.tally, desc(n_sig_term)) %>% pull(domain))) %>% 
  arrange(Biodomain)

ggplot(enr.bd, aes(hs, mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = color),color = 'grey20', shape = 21, alpha = .5)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lwd = .1)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lwd = .1)+
  labs(x = 'Mayo TCX\nGSEA NES', y = '12mo male 5xFAD\nGSEA NES')+
  facet_wrap(~Biodomain, scales = 'free')+
  scale_fill_identity()
```

There are several terms from multiple biodomains that are enriched in similar 
directions (i.e. from the up-regulated genes in both human AD and 5xFAD). There 
are fewer that are enriched in opposite directions (i.e. up in human AD and down 
in 5xFAD, e.g. see Vasculature and Mitochondrial Metabolism), but there are many 
terms that are unique to either the human or the mouse data set.

Overall, by aligning human and mouse omics signatures through the lens of 
domains affected in each context, we can get a better understanding of the 
relationships between the biological processes affected in each context. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- AMP-AD gene modules represent major transcriptomic heterogeneity in AD
- Correlation of logFC is a practical approach for human-mouse alignment of 
AD-associated transcriptomic signatures
- Functional gene set signatures are also a useful point of comparison between 
species
- Subsetting functions into associated Biological Domains allows for more 
granular comparisons.
