For this lesson, you will be working in the R programming language and the 
RStudio development environment.

## Software Setup

### R

Please download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). To interact with R, we use 
[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). If you don't have administrative 
rights to your laptop, please ask the IT help desk to install software for you. Once 
you have installed R and RStudio, open RStudio to verify that the installation 
was successful.

### Package Installation

Next, install the required packages for this lesson. In RStudio, copy and paste the 
following commands into the Console:

```r
# install synapser
install.packages("synapser", repos = c("http://ran.synapse.org", "http://cran.fhcrc.org"))

# install tidyverse if you don't already have it
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")
```

Once the installation has finished, copy and paste the following commands into 
the console to verify that packages installed correctly.

```r
library(synapser)
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, you will need to log in to your Synapse account.

*Login option 1*: Synapser takes credentials from your Synapse web session. If you are 
logged into the Synapse web browser, synapser will automatically use your login 
credentials to log you in during your R session! All you have to do is:

```r
synLogin()
```

If for whatever reason that didn’t work, try one of these options:

*Login option 2*: Synapse username and password In the code below, replace the `< >` with 
your Synapse username and password.

```r
synLogin("<username>", "<password>")
```

*Login option 3*: Synapse PAT If you usually log in to Synapse with your Google account, 
you will need to use a Synapser Personal Access Token (PAT) to log in with the R client. 
Follow these instructions to generate a personal access token, then paste the PAT into the 
code below. Make sure you scope your access token to allow you to View, Download, and
Modify.

```r
synLogin(authToken = "<paste your personal access token here>")
```

For more information on managing Synapse credentials with synapser, see
the documentation here: https://r-docs.synapse.org/articles/manageSynapseCredentials.html.



## Project Setup

Before you begin, determine your working directory (`get(wd)` and `set(wd)`), and 
create two new folders within your preferred working directory entitled `data`
and `results`. You can copy and paste the following commands into the R console.

```r
dir.create("data")
dir.create("results")
```

## Data Set Download

While you can always download data from the AD Portal website via your web browser, it’s 
usually faster and often more convenient to download data programmatically.

**Download a single file** 
To download a single file from the AD Knowledge
Portal, you can click the linked file name to go to a page in the
Synapse platform where that file is stored. Using the synID on that
page, you can call the synGet() function from synapser to download the
file.

**Exercise 1**: Use Explore Data to find processed RNAseq data from the
Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD Study. 

https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/


This filters the table to a single file. In the
“Id” column for this htseqcounts_5XFAD.txt file, there is a unique
Synapse ID (synID).

We can then use that synID to download the file.

```r
counts_id <- "syn22108847"
synGet(counts_id, downloadLocation = "../data/")
```

## Bulk download files

**Exercise 2**: Use Explore Studies to find all metadata
files from the Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD study.

Use the facets and search bar to
look for data you want to download from the AD Knowledge Portal. Once
you’ve identified the files you want, click on the download arrow icon
on the top right of the Explore Data table and select “Programmatic
Options” from the drop-down menu.

In the window that pops up, select the “R” tab from the top menu bar.
This will display some R code that constructs a SQL query of the Synapse
data table that drives the AD Knowledge Portal. This query will allow us
to download only the files that meet our search criteria.

The function synTableQuery() returns a Synapse object wrapper around a
CSV file that is automatically downloaded to a Synapse cache directory
.synapseCache in your home directory. You can use query\$filepath to see
the path to the file in the Synapse cache.

```r
# download the results of the filtered table query
query <- synTableQuery("SELECT * FROM syn11346063.52 WHERE ( ( `study` HAS ( 'Jax.IU.Pitt_5XFAD' ) ) AND ( `resourceType` = 'metadata' ) )")

# view the file path of the resulting csv
query$filepath
```

We’ll use read.csv to read the CSV file into R (although the provided
read.table or any other base R version is also fine!). We can explore
the download_table object and see that it contains information on all of
the AD Portal data files we want to download. Some columns like the “id”
and “parentId” columns contain info about where the file is in Synapse,
and some columns contain AD Portal annotations for each file, like
“dataType”, “specimenID”, and “assay”. This annotation table will later
allow us to link downloaded files to additional metadata variables!

```r
# read in the table query csv file
download_table <- read_csv(query$filepath, show_col_types = FALSE)

download_table
```

Finally, we use a mapping function from the purrr package to loop
through the “id” column and apply the synGet() function to each file’s
synID. In this case, we use purrr::walk() because it lets us call
synGet() for its side effect (downloading files to a location we
specify), and returns nothing.

```r
# loop through the column of synIDs and download each file
purrr::walk(download_table$id, ~synGet(.x, downloadLocation = "../data/"))
```

Congratulations, you have bulk downloaded files from the AD Knowledge
Portal!

**An important note**: for situations where you are downloading many large
files, the R client performs substantially slower than the command line
client or the Python client. In these cases, you can use the
instructions and code snippets for the command line or Python client
provided in the “Programmatic Options” menu.
